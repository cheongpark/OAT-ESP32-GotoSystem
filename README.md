# OpenAstroTracker(OAT) Auto Calibration System

## Project Overview

Hello, I am developing this project to solve the complex calibration process of OAT (OpenAstroTracker). While I have built an OAT, I have not actually used it and am not very familiar with the hardware aspects.

I aim to create a calibration system that makes the tedious calibration process as user-friendly as possible, allowing users to automatically prepare for all astronomical observations simply by powering on the device.

### Project Goals
- High accuracy and performance at low cost
- Development using affordable ESP32 without requiring expensive computers

### Project Notes
- All project documentation and content will be written in Korean as I am a Korean developer
- The project may be temporarily paused during July-August due to mandatory military service
- All Korean documentation will be translated to English using LLM (Language Learning Models)
- If someone contributes significantly to this project, I will try my best to write in English
